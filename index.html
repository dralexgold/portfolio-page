    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>I come from an unconventional family of numerous step/half mother/father/sister/brothers and moved from the USA to Sydney when I was 19 and haven't looked back. My <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/INTJ"> personality type is INTJ</a> - I'd say it's about 80% accurate.</p>

    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>I loathed all exercise when I grew up but I have been training CrossFit for five years and probably will forever. I even worked as a CrossFit trainer while I was studying. I also drink too much wine and own two cats.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>I'd like to run a government department, either state or local government.</p>
    <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
    <p>I generally like synthy stuff built on the likes of New Order, Pet Shop Boys, Depeche Mode, etc. People singing to each other makes me nervous though so I'm not a fan of musicals.</p>
    <h2>What's important to you?</h2>
    <p>Strong relationships with friends and family, and continuing to build those relationships by trying new things and taking friends and family out of their comfort zones.</p>
